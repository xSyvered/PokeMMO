# PokeMMO Database

Welcome to the PokéMMO Database!

This GitHub repository is a place for the community to gather around and create up-to-date, correct, and complete guides of several PokéMMO features such as Berry Farming, Breeding, Crafting, etc.

You can always suggest new additions and changes to documents in this repository by submitting them on our forum post on the PokéMMO forums or on this repository's [Issues Page](https://github.com/xSyvered/PokeMMO/issues).

Right now we are currently focused on gathering information to complete the Ultimate Berry Farming Guide, so if you want to give us a hand, drop by on our forum post!
